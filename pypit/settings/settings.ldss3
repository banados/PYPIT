# SIMPLE RULES:
#
# 1. If a keyword is specified in science/pixflat/blzflat/trace/bias/arc frames
#    it must also appear in the Keyword identifiers list.
# 2. You must check NAXIS is 2 in ``checks to perform''.
# 3. If a keyword value contains only some interesting value,
#    you can split the keyword value using the '%,' notation.
#    For example, suppose you have the string 10:50:23.45, and
#    you're interested in the 50 for a match condition, you would
#    use '%' to indicate you want to split the keyword value, ':'
#    indicates the delimiter text, '1' indicates you're interested
#    in the 1st argument (0-indexed), '<60' is an example criteria.
#    Each of these should be specified in this order, separated by
#    commas, so the final string would be:
#    %,:,1,<60
# 4. If the text '|' appears in the match condition, the absolute
#    value will be taken. For example '|<=0.05' means that a given
#    keyword's value for a calibration frame must be within 0.05 of
#    a science frame's value, in order to be matched.
# 5. If a keyword's value contains spaces, replace all spaces with
#    one underscore.
# 6. If the header contains two keyword's of the same name, only
#    the value of the first one will be recognised.
# 7. Strictly speaking, ARMLSD likes a one-to-one relationship between
#    a given frame and a frame type. If you would like a one-to-many
#    relationship (i.e. a given frame can be both a pixel and a blaze
#    flat, use the canbe option).
#
