LDSS3 long-slit observations by Drew Newman

LDSS reads out in two amps, so there are *c1.fits and *c2.fits files for each exposure. My targets are always in the c1 chip, so I include those only here.


0004-0013  Bias
0032-0034 Flat
0058-0060 HeNeAr
0119 P234-16
0121 P235-17


a standard star was observed in the 2x1 binning (Drew's setup) so it has has its own calibrations:

0014-0023 Bias
0024-0031 Flat
0054-0057 HeNeAr
0113-0114 EG274 [white dwarf]
